# Skeletos 

Skeletos is an in-memory state management framework for building large scale client and server applications. It works across 
browsers/node/react-native and pretty much anything that can run javascript.

Skeletos is used mostly for managing state and data lifecycle in React applications. It is meant to be used 
*instead of* frameworks like Redux and Flux. Skeletos adopts the best design patterns that scale, while allowing you to
focus on business logic.

This is a mono-repo built with [Hammerpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hammerpack). It contains the core Skeletos 
framework as well as other Skeletos add-ons such as Skeletos for React, Router, Express, Sequelize, and more!
