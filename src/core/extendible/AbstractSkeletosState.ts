/**
 * The AbstractSkeletosState is what you, as an application developer, would use to build out your
 * application. The AbstractSkeletosState would be the superclass of all your application state,
 * whether it is state that you need to store as random data retrieved from the server,
 * or temporary data that the user has generated, or UI properties that need to be supplied
 * to your UI components.
 *
 * An AbstractSkeletosState is built on top of a SkeletosCursor, which in turn is built on top of SkeletosDb,
 * which is a tree database. A SkeletosCursor points to a specific node in the tree.
 *
 * The AbstractSkeletosState is the top layer in the data access stack:
 *
 * ----------------------
 * AbstractSkeletosState    <--- We are here
 * ----------------------
 * SkeletosCursor
 * ----------------------
 * SkeletosDb
 * ----------------------
 *
 * An AbstractSkeletosState is extremely lightweight: it only owns two properties: one that represents
 * the cursor with which it gets/sets data, and another a unique hash of the cursor.
 *
 * By associating AbstractSkeletosState to a single SkeletosCursor, we know that an AbstractSkeletosState can only
 * represent a particular node in the tree and nothing else. Each property of an AbstractSkeletosState that you code in
 * your application, however, will represent a child cursor. And thus, you can build out an entire class-typed
 * application state tree using AbstractSkeletosStates.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------
 *
 * So you know a single AbstractSkeletosState refers to a single SkeletosCursor and thus a single node in the tree.
 * But AbstractSkeletosState in reality refers to a single SkeletosCursor at a specific time. It does this by storing
 * a unique hash when the AbstractSkeletosState is constructed.
 *
 * So what is a unique hash?
 * Every node in the tree db has a unique hash value assigned. When you set a value on a node, the hash value of
 * that node gets updated. In addition, all the hash values from that node up to the root (path too root)
 * are changed. This is perfect when you want to build UI applications with a technology like React as
 * each node can represent a Node, and updating a value will allow all components to the root to get updated.
 *
 * What this means is that AbstractSkeletosState is extremely lightweight and temporary: create a new one every time
 * you want to supply it to your UI components for example. And don't ever cache AbstractSkeletosState!
 *
 * This brings us to the next point: An AbstractSkeletosState does not represent an immutable value. This is because
 * SkeletosDb is not an immutable tree store: it turns out immutability is a huge performance inhibitor in
 * large applications. What Skeletos does provide you with is a unique hash to compare the state of modifications
 * to the values, which you can do fast equality checks on in your UI components.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------
 *
 * Finally, note that an AbstractSkeletosState can exist in two forms: read-only and writable.
 *
 * A read-only AbstractSkeletosState is created out of a read-only cursor, and a writable AbstractSkeletosState is
 * created out of a writable cursor. A writable cursor has a SkeletosTransaction associated with it, whereas a
 * read-only cursor does not.
 *
 * An AbstractSkeletosState cannot change from read-only to writable or vice-versa. To make a writable
 * AbstractSkeletosState out of a read-only AbstractSkeletosState, you would do something like:
 *
 * const myReadOnlyState: MyState = new MyState(someCursor);
 * const myWritableState: MyState = new MyState(myReadOnlyState, transaction);
 *
 * Here, myWritableState is a writable copy of myReadOnlyState.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------
 *
 * Note: this class is purposely not marked abstract because it needs to be instantiated as a standalone in certain cases.
