/**
 * A Skeletos action is the place where you would modify any Skeletos state. For example, you can
 * modify state based on some user interaction, or you can modify state as a result of retrieving data from the server.
 * You can even modify state "in anticipation" of modification calls to the server before the calls are returned (a
 * technique known as optimistic updates).
 *
 * 1. An action is composed of multiple commands. The action can execute these commands in parallel, sequentially or
 * in some defined order. Under the covers, the action uses async.auto(..) to determine the pipeline of commands
 * that need to be executed. See getCommands(..).
 *
 * 2. Each action gets a unique SkeletosTransaction which it uses to perform all state modifications under. Whenever
 * an error occurs as part of the action's commands, this transaction is rolled back.
 *
 * 3. Every action can have some loading or error state that you can set. When set, the action will set loading in
 * loading state at the beginning of the action, and will unset loading in the loading state at the end of the action.
 * Additionally, if error state is set, the action will use error state to post details of the errorMessage.
